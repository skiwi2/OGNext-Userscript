OLog-Userscript
===============

Getting started
---------------

OLog mainly consists of two parts. You are currently looking at the client part.
Currently the userscript has only been tested using Firefox and Greasemonkey.

Build, run and deploy
-----------

Either clone the repository, checkout the develop tree and add the script to Greasemonkey or simply copy the script into the add-on.

Open your OGame account and look for the box saying `OLog Settings` (should be right under `Shop`). Fill in the server details. If you're running a local server with default settings, the path should be:

    http://localhost:8080/OLog-*

Where `*` is the current version.
